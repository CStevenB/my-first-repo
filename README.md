### Geography

I live in the village of Woodridge, in the state of New York
in the United States. Woodridge is about 90 miles northwest of 
New York City.

### Reading

I just finished reading *Severance* by Ling Ma. Before that I 
read *Convenience Store Woman* by Sayaka Morata.

### Food

All the restaurants are closed here due to the virus. I've been cooking at home!
